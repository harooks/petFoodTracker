# petFoodTracker
This app keeps track of whether your dog (or really any type of pet!) has been fed or not.

First time users would need to create an account using their email address and password, and they have to reenter credentials only if they logout. Each account is for a household, so they share a login to manage the pets they have.

The interface has two buttons, one for breakfast and one for dinner. When it's time for you to feed your pet, you will get a notification notifying you to do so. Once someone feeds the pet, they should press on the empty bowl to notify other people on the account (household members) that the pet has been fed.
