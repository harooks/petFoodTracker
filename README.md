# petFoodTracker
This app keeps track of whether your dog has been fed or not. 

First, the user must sign in using their email address and password. Once the user has logged in, they won't have to login. A new user must create a new account.

The interface has two buttons, each for breakfast and dinner. 
When it's time for you to feed your pet, you will get a notification telling you to feed your pet. Once someone feeds the pet, they should press on the empty bowl to notify other people in the account that the pet has been fed.
